# Asset Shuffle 5
 
Welcome to Asset Shuffle 5! This week's theme: 3D.

This asset shuffle will be an introduction to making 3D games!

Our fifth Asset Shuffle consists of the following assets:  
- [Food pack - 3D Microgames Add-Ons](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/food-pack-3d-microgames-add-ons-163295)
- [RPG Poly Pack - Lite](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/rpg-poly-pack-lite-148410)
- [3D Free Modular Kit](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/3d-free-modular-kit-85732)

There are two scripts to enable the player to drag and drop objects with left click and look around with right click.

The pack was built in Unity version **2019.4.25f1 (LTS)**.

Have fun!
